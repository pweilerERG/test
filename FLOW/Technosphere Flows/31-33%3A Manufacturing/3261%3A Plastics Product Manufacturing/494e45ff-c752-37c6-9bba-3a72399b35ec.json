A white, SPPR PVC roofing membrane consists of two plies or layers of PVC material with a polyester reinforcement scrim between the layers (Figure 1). The top ply has special additives to make the membrane UV stable, plasticizers to make it flexible, and pigments for color. The bottom ply is typically darker in color containing fewer pigments by weight, but otherwise contains a similar mix of plasticizers, stabilizers, fillers and fire-retardant additives.","category":"Technosphere Flows/31-33: Manufacturing/3261: Plastics Product Manufacturing","version":"00.00.006","lastChange":"2021-08-10T11:39:25.454Z","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","isInfrastructureFlow":false,"flowProperties":[{"@type":"FlowPropertyFactor","flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"conversionFactor":1.47},{"@type":"FlowPropertyFactor","isRefFlowProperty":true,"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"conversionFactor":1.0}]}
