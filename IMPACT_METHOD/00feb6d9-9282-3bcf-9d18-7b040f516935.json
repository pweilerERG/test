The flowable and context input files for IPCC are used by the LCIA Formatter to translate the names from the IPCC source file and generate a mapping file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context combinations which can be mapped to IPCC characterization factors. It also includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.\n\n","version":"01.01.001","lastChange":"2023-11-03T18:31:54.843Z","impactCategories":[{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"558e33ca-a7a9-3b28-834a-0720e2f48772","name":"AR4-20","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"8b84b6e3-0206-328c-bde0-fc10bdbef526","name":"AR4-100","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"c873257d-3c82-385d-b6b2-2e14bc1c308b","name":"AR4-500","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"855d82e0-0b4d-3b9e-84cb-b064486b5423","name":"AR5-20","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"7d05b807-2caa-3cd9-b55c-399d3b820cbc","name":"AR5-100","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"80f73b5d-0b71-3193-b8a6-04857897dec1","name":"AR6-20","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"a6206006-65bc-395c-8dc9-f12262f45a04","name":"AR6-100","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"4bb30cb7-394d-37a7-9c60-c0bb9d401316","name":"AR6-500","category":"IPCC","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"}]}
