{"@type":"ImpactMethod","@id":"ed2353f9-9db5-32b0-b6a8-7bf29f6f46c8","name":"TRACI 2.1","description":"TRACI 2.1 is built from LCIA Formatter v1.1.3 and flows from the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.2.3\n\nTRACI 2.1 source file: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-12/traci_2_1_2014_dec_10_0.xlsx\nSource citation: Bare 2012\nTRACI 2.1 flowable and context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL GitHub Repository: https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist\nThe LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies TRACI 2.1 characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL. The flowable and context input files for TRACI 2.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter to translate the names from the TRACI 2.1 source file and generate a mapping file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context combinations which can be mapped to TRACI 2.1 characterization factors. It also includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.\n\nAdditional flowable mappings were included for general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, and Selenium) in the FEDEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI 2.1 (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application of TRACI 2.1 characterization factors when the general name of the metal is reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. Duplicate names for flowables exist in TRACI 2.1 which have different characterization factors and different CAS. These occur due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the entries with the currently recognized CAS are accepted and the other flowables are ignored. FEDEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI 2.1 to enable impact assessment across most of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available TRACI 2.1 contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the relevant characterization factors from TRACI 2.1. Normalization and weighting factors are not provided in the TRACI 2.1 source file and are not added here.","version":"01.01.002","lastChange":"2024-05-08T20:53:13.968Z","impactCategories":[{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"8c5a0a4c-ea1a-33b6-a973-43988d1b61f4","name":"Eutrophication","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg N eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"6037e49a-4adb-3a31-a23d-c82569e3242f","name":"Acidification","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg SO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"cfb3b79b-2141-3357-91d4-b8e3f00586d4","name":"Human health - particulate matter","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"PM 2.5 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"cdced312-e381-31c7-9a62-309fa62b3ba2","name":"Smog formation","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg O3 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"d21c7132-2861-3d6b-9bc8-590627a087b4","name":"Global warming","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"264097d3-cd2c-3d75-998a-f170ab543c9a","name":"Ozone depletion","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"kg CFC-11 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"4635115b-b3bd-3883-825b-fb0eab57381f","name":"Human health - non-cancer","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"CTUnoncancer"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"0a8ce516-20fa-3b01-bbbe-c0b8cb4e4c63","name":"Human health - cancer","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"CTUcancer"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"2888aa63-f97b-3407-b56e-4d103dc1246d","name":"Freshwater ecotoxicity","category":"TRACI 2.1_adapted","refUnit":"CTUeco"}]}
