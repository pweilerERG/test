{"@type":"Process","@id":"7fa00b86-ca0f-321a-94a6-c8f68338a7cb","name":"Cladding, roll formed, at plant","description":"Roll forming is a continuous bending operation in which a strip of metal (typically coiled steel or aluminum) is passed through consecutive sets of rolls, or stands, each performing only an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section profile is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing parts with long lengths or in large quantities with a minimum amount of handling as compared to other types of forming (i.e. press brake). A variety of cross-section profiles can be produced, but each profile requires a carefully crafted set of roll tools.  Producing the panels requires a five-stage process, as follows: The metal coils are introduced from an uncoiler (1). A flattener ensures an even, consistent surface for shaping (2). Any punching is done by presses prior to forming (3). The coil then enters a series of rolls designed to incrementally shape the steel sheet into the desired profile (4). Finally, the roll formed sheet is sheared to the required length, and stacked for inspection and final packaging (5).  The roll forming process process includes all material and inbound transportation necessary for construction-ready products: coated steel coils, auxiliary inputs, and packaging materials.  Energy and utility inputs include electricity, natural gas, and propane.  All known solid waste, air, and water emissions are captured in the output.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3321: Forging and Stamping","version":"00.02.016","lastChange":"2024-06-24T19:30:25.128Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-31","validUntil":"2015-02-27","geographyDescription":"North America","technologyDescription":"Steel sheet with corrugated profile designs.
