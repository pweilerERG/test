{"@type":"Process","@id":"f3b8fc97-f519-3da0-80de-72a7d5551fda","name":"Wood Combusted, at boiler, at hardboard mill","description":"This process is for the combustion of 1 kg of oven dry wood, combusted in the wood boilers commonly used at wood production facilities.  Data is from primary industry data from the softwood lumber, softwood plywood, and oriented strandboard industries located in the US. \n \nThis process documents the inputs and outputs associated with wood combustion boilers onsite at wood product producing mills in the U.S. The data were obtained through a scientifically sound and consistent process established by the Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM), following ISO14040/140444 standards (ISO 2006) and Product Category Rules (PCR) for North American Structural and Architectural Wood Products (FPInnovations 2011).  Lumber, plywood, and oriented strandboard production facilities were surveyed asking details regarding onsite energy generation. Regional differences did not exist between the Pacific Northwest and southeast regions to warrant separate boilers based on geographical regions.  There was also a potential for emission differences based on biomass type and quality.  Plywood and oriented strandboard industries could have boiler inputs likely containing resins. There could be a potential difference in regions, based on wood species, moisture contents, and wood quality.  Differences found are reported in this report. \n \nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has  undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet  undergone a formal validation process.
