{"@type":"Process","@id":"ca1d1dfa-fd3c-35f1-bea7-a037251deb04","name":"Hardboard, at hardboard plant","description":"Manufacturing hardboard in North America currently uses either a wet or dry production processes to create high-density wood composition panels. The wet and dry processes use a thermo-mechanical processes to reduce the wood chips or raw material to individual fibers. Resins are added to the fibers before or during mat forming and then the (dry or wet) mats are pressed to create the hardboard panel. Final products made from uncoated hardboard commonly called “dealer board” include case-goods, paneling and pegboard. Density for the final products ranges from 800 to 1,100 kg/m3. Hardboard is a panel product developed to utilize industrial wood residue. The production of hardboard falls into the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 321219—reconstituted wood products—which include other wood composite products such as cellulosic fiberboard, medium density fiberboard, particleboard, and oriented strand board.  EWST are composite panels designed and manufactured to perform in applications with the appearance of traditional wood. In addition, all hardboard/EWST plants follow the ‘Eco-certified composite sustainability standard’. \n \nAll allocations performed using mass or volume. This sheet sets out each unit process in the production of one cubic meter of cellulosic fiberbaord as produced in the North America. For the year 2012 7 hardboard facilities operated in North America. These seven facilities produced 205 million m2 at 3.2-mm basis equaling 650 thousand m3 of hardboard.   \n \nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has  undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet  undergone a formal validation process.
