Various uses and applications for fiberboard include: 1. Sound-deadening board, 2. Structural sheathing, and 3. Roofing substrate (i.e., roof fiberboard). Asphalt is both used internally as a binder to improve strength properties and externally as a coating.   Cellulosic fiberboard is a panel product developed to utilize industrial wood residue. Wood residues originate from industrial wood waste such as shavings, sawdust, and chips produced during other wood manufacturing processes and from under-utilized whole trees.  Additional feedstock sources include mixed paper and construction wood waste. Cellulosic fiberboard falls into the Standard Industrial Classification of reconstituted wood products. Over the last several decades cellulosic fiberboard has evolved into a highly engineered product designed to meet specific end-use requirements.  The most common dimensions of cellulosic fiberboard panels are 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) thick, 4.0 feet (1.22 m) wide and 8.0 (2.44 m) long.  However thickness, width, and length can vary to meet end-use requirements. \n \nBase process data presented with allocations to within process co-products noted.  Refer to allocation worksheet for specifics.  All allocations performed using mass or volume. This sheet sets out each unit process in the production of one cubic meter of cellulosic fiberbaord as produced in the North America.  \n \nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has  undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet  undergone a formal validation process.
