NatureWorks introduced in December 2008 new lactic acid production data. ","geographyDescription":"In November 2001 NatureWorks LLC started the production of Ingeo in its 140,000 metric-ton-per-year manufacturing facility in Blair, Nebraska. One year later, NatureWorks started producing lactic acid in its 180,000-metric-ton-per-year manufacturing facility located next to the polymer plant. As of 2010, these two plants are the only large-scale commercial production facilities for PLA world-wide. Corn production data was collected from producers in Nebraska and Iowa. ","technologyDescription":"Ingeo polylactide polymer production technology is used in this model which was developed by NatureWorks LLC. This technology includes the polymerization of lactide to make polylactide polymer. Five major steps are included in this dataset: corn production and transport of corn to the corn processing wet mill, corn processing and the conversion of starch into dextrose, conversion of dextrose into lactic acid, conversion of lactic acid into lactide, and polymerization of lactide into polylactide polymer pellets. \r\n\r\nCorn production includes all relevant inputs and outputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, emissions, and incoming and outgoing transportation. After harvest, the corn grain is transported to a corn wet mill, where the starch is separated from the other components of the corn kernel and hydrolyzed to dextrose using enzymes. The unrefined dextrose solution is transported by pipeline to the fermentation process where lactic acid is produced. The lactic acid broth is acidified by adding sulfuric acid, resulting in the formation and precipitation of small quantities of gypsum which are finally used in land application and so replacing mined gypsum. A credit is given for the avoided gypsum mining. In the final stage of production, Ingeo is prepared through the polymerization of lactide to make polylactide polymer.\r\n\r\nSteam is being produced in a natural gas fired steam boiler located at the site. Make up potabe water is included in the inventory and well as electricity use by the steam boiler. The Ingeo production process is equipped with two thermal oxidizers converting organic process emissions into carbon dioxide and water. Also the natural gas consumption of the thermal oxidizers is taken into account. ","inventoryMethodDescription":"Mix of system and unit processes. In the dataset provided primary inputs are traced back to the extraction of the raw materials from the earth. There are four exceptions. For electricity use, natural gas combusted in industrial boiler and natural gas combusted in industrial equipment the upstream and in case of natural gas the upstream and combustion data are used as provided in the US LCI database. The latter is also valid for the fuels required to transport the corn from the field to the corn wet mill. In this case the final data provided is better comparable with the other polymer data present in the database. For all the other processes aggregated data has been provided to protect proprietary information. These aggregated data were reviewed by Boustead Consulting. ","modelingConstantsDescription":"The data provided in the spreadsheets and the underlying data module report is onlyvalid for Ingeo produced by NatureWorks in Blair Nebraska and not for PLA production in general. The life cycle inventory data for PLA produced elsewhere will be different due to different raw materials (sugar or starch source) and raw material production practices, different technologies for processing these raw materials, different fermentation and polymerisation technology and different background data for electricity/fuel mixes used.","completenessDescription":"Although attempts to fully account for the impacts of seed corn production could lead to an endless recursive accounting of ever more diminutive impacts, never quite reaching zero, the LCI reasonably accounts for the energy production associated with seed corn production. The average seed consumption is estimated at 0.00193 kg/kg corn. The pesticide emissions to air and water were copied from the US LCI inventory module \"corn, whole plant, at field\"  which gives average data for US corn production. No specific data were available for pesticide use in East Nebraska and West Iowa. All values were multiplied by a factor 1.527 to express them per kg biopolymer resin. The data includes all relevant inputs for dextrose production such as the production and delivery of natural gas, electricity and steam consumed, as well as the production of potable and cooling water, compressed air, chemicals (sulfur dioxide and calcium hydroxide) and enzymes. Electricity consumption and the process emissions (to air and water) of the on-site facility are included in the inventory. ","dataSelectionDescription":"During the modeling process a few solid waste stream had to be renamed, these are detailed in the module report.","samplingDescription":"Data for Ingeo production was collected from NatureWorks LLC\u0027s manufacturing facilities.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"8b35a46c-d14d-38fe-beba-20c7905ebdbe","name":"E.T.H.
