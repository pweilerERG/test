Possible differences in the mass balance stem from small amounts of inputs which are not included in the analysis, solid wastes shown as outputs that are not shown as inputs, as well as possibly some emissions from burning the overhead losses within the plant. Complete inventory data and metadata are shown in full in the final report, Life Cycle Inventory of Polymer Composites. The report is not publicly available. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi, Anne Marie Molen, and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACMA members. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

When the reaction is complete, the resulting fluid polyester is cooled and blended with a vinylic reactive monomer. Styrene is the most common reactive diluent used in UPR production. Water is a by-product of the esterification reaction and is continuously removed during the esterification step to drive the reaction to completion. This water is sent to a thermal oxidizer to eliminate the hydrocarbons. The waste heat generated from the thermal oxidation process is sometimes utilized to produce steam energy for re-use within the UPR production facility. In some manufacturing sites, the oxidized vapor is released directly to the air without capture and re-use of the waste heat. The final UPR product is shipped to composite fabricators via drum, tote, or bulk tankers where it is combined with other materials, such as fibers and fillers, and processed into a finished or semi-finished part.","samplingDescription":"Data are from primary sources. The unsaturated polyester producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of US UPR production facilities.
