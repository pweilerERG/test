{"@type":"Process","@id":"44a82a4a-95fd-3c31-9829-cf0763dd3a93","name":"Polyol ether, for flexible foam polyurethane production, at plant","description":"This gate-to-gate unit process represents the production of one kilogram of polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane produced in North America. The studied system boundary includes elementary flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane, and disposal of process wastes. The four producers that provided data for this average dataset stated that standard polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane technology is used. The captured polyether polyol production amount included in this dataset is approximately 90 percent of the polyether polyol used for flexible foam polyurethane in the U.S. in 2015; the remaining 10 percent is manufactured by producers that did not contribute to this dataset. This unit process includes cutoff flows that represent process waste disposal and waste fuel gas which is created from other processes on-site. There are no coproducts in this unit process therefore no allocation was performed for polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane manufacturing.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2017-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane production from 2015 and 2017. For the primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of polyether polyol production prior to the project initiation date. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. Three plants provided data for the year 2015, while another plant provided data from 2017.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethane production in North America. Production data were collected from 4 producers (4 plants) in the United States and aggregated using horizontal averaging. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data.","technologyDescription":"The technology used to manufacture polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes in North America begins with the introduction of a potassium hydroxide catalyst to a polyol initiator, such as a triol. This solution is reacted with propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to form an intermediate. Water is then added to this intermediate. A solvent is introduced, which absorbs the polyol from the water/catalyst. The density difference between the aqueous \u0026 organic phases is used to separate the two phases. Finally, the polyol is purified of solvent, side products and water through distillation.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements are not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"All polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes production data was sourced from primary producers. The data collection methods for polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes include information provided by direct measurement, purchasing and utility records, calculations from equipment specifications, and engineering estimates. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the reporting companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes upstream burdens from incoming materials, incoming transportation of materials, polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes manufacturing, and process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements. \r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION: Data were collected from three polyether polyol for flexible foam polyurethanes manufacturers (four plants).\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Uncertainty was not calculated.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected for the years 2015 or 2017.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"2e0b26c4-fb98-4a60-a22c-1c1071b7e23f","name":"American Chemistry Council, 2022, Polyether Polyol for Flexible Foam Polyurethanes"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The data providers reviewed their data and the average.
