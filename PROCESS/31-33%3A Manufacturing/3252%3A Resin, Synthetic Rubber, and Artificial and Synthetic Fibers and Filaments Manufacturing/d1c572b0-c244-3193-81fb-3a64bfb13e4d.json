The technical scope of this study is gate-to-gate and the system boundary includes incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes. The technology used to manufacture HIPS in North America involves dispensing styrene in water in a reactor and polymerizing in the presence of initiators and suspending agents. The HIPS producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American HIPS production. The captured HIPS production amount is approximately 62 percent of the HIPS production in the U.S. in 2015. ","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"02.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2016-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of HIPS production from 2015-2016. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015 or 2016 was a representative year for their company for HIPS production in North America.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average HIPS production in North America. All HIPS data collected were from 5 plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions), and Franklin Associates’ private database. The HIPS producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American HIPS production. The captured HIPS production amount is approximately 62 percent of U.S. HIPS production in 2015.","technologyDescription":"HIPS resin producers from the United States provided data from their facilities using technology ranging from average to state-of-the-art. Most of the producers use mass polymerization in continuous reactors, while others stated confidential processes with less detail provided. Mass polymerization begins with the styrene monomer being fed along with processing aids into a reactor. Other chemicals can be added, such as chain transfer agents or anti-oxidants, but these are normally below the one percent threshold for inclusion. Ethylbenzene or toluene may also be added in small amounts to control the polymerization rate. The polybutadiene is shredded and melted into a suspension with styrene monomer. In the reactor, the styrene is grafted onto the polybutadiene. The polystyrene reaction gives off heat as polystyrene solids are formed, which is used to heat the feed with the excess removed from the process. Tower reactors are then used to achieve high polystyrene conversion. Following discharge from tower reactors, the polystyrene stream is devolatilized, which separates out the polymer from the remaining monomer with solvent. This stream is recycled back into the reactor at regular intervals. The polymer is extruded into pellets for transport to fabricators.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of HIPS. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. Secondary supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.","completenessDescription":"Treatment of Missing Environmental Data: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Missing Technosphere Data: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMass Balance: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All HIPS production data was sourced from primary producers. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average HIPS datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"Boundary Conditions: The system boundary includes HIPS manufacturing, and includes incoming transportation and upstream burdens for each material as well as process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements. \r\n\r\nData Collection: Data were collected from four HIPS manufacturers.\r\n\r\nUncertainty Estimation: Uncertainty was not calculated.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected for the years 2015 or 2016.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"580acf2e-3548-4d6e-aee9-32289fa9de46","name":"American Chemistry Council, 2022, HIPS"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The data providers reviewed their data and the average.
