In this analysis, PET resin is only considered to be manufactured by the esterification of PTA with ethylene glycol and loss of water. No PET from dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) is considered in this dataset. PET from DMT are still used in North America for creating specialized products from PET, but these amounts are small compared to the use of PTA as a source for PET.  The average data in this analysis includes PET resin manufactured using three technologies; melt phase and solid-state polymerization (SSP), melt-to-resin (MTR®) and Integrex®.  A simplified description of each technology used is provided below.\r\n\r\nMost commonly, melt phase and solid-state polymerization is used to manufacture PET resin.  This process requires two polymerization steps.  The first polymerization step, the melt phase polymerization, is the esterification of ethylene glycol and PTA yielding a loss of water under high pressure and temperature.  This step produces a low intrinsic viscosity PET pellets suitable for making clothing.  A second polymerization step, solid-state polymerization, is used to achieve bottle-grade PET.  This step raises the temperature of the solid pellets in the absence of oxygen and water.  Polymer chains lengthen by using vacuum or inert gas.  Temperature, pressure and the diffusion of by-products from inside the pellet are key to accomplishing SSP.  \t\r\n\r\nMelt-to-Resin (MTR®) technology is used by one of the data providers.  In addition to ethylene glycol and purified terephthalic acid feedstocks, isophthalic acid and other additives are used in a melt phase polymerization.  This technology uses a 2-reactor process that produces a resin with a high intrinsic viscosity, making it unnecessary to undergo additional steps required by solid state polymerization.\t\r\n\r\nThe patented Integrex® technology is used in one data provider producing PET resin.  This technology differs from the other technologies used in the stage from the paraxylene feeding, through the production of PET.  This technology integrates the paraxylene-to-PTA and PTA-to-PET steps, which were separated for this analysis to create horizontal averages of each unit process.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-12-31","validUntil":"2015-11-30","timeDescription":"All primary data were collected from 2015.","geographyDescription":"LCI data for the production of PET resin were collected from three producers (seven plants) in North America – all in the United States.

Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the PET production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n\r\n","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected from 2015.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"bd5a4c58-b1e8-47ac-9c60-782916934117","name":"Franklin Associates (2019) Cradle-to-Resin LCA PET for NAPCOR"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"Internal review of data entry proofreading, mass balance verification and data documentation.","assessment":[],"reviewers":[{"@type":"Actor","@id":"38e67478-a915-43d9-ad67-e25db79a4acc","name":"Franklin Associates, A Division of ERG","category":"Organisations"}]}],"intendedApplication":"\"Accounting, with system-external interactions\" - The intended application is a purely descriptive accounting / documentation of the analysed system including existing interactions with other systems in the LCI model.
