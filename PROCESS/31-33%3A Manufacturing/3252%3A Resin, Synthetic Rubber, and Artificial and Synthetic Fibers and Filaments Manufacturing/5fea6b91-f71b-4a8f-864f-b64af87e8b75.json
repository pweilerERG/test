{"@type":"Process","@id":"5fea6b91-f71b-4a8f-864f-b64af87e8b75","name":"Vinyl ester resin; at plant","description":"This gate-to-gate unit process represents the production of one kilogram of vinyl ester resin produced in the United States. The studied system boundary includes flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of vinyl ester resin, and disposal of process wastes. The four producers and five facilities that provided data for this average dataset stated that standard vinyl ester technology is used. Vinyl ester resin is produced by the esterification of an epoxy resin with an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. This unit process includes cutoff flows that represent process waste disposal, renewable electricity, silica sand, bisphenol A, and acrylic acid. There are no coproducts in this system process therefore no allocation was performed on the average values.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2022-10-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of vinyl ester resin production from data collected in 2021 and 2022. For the primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the most recent full year of vinyl ester production prior to the project initiation date. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2021 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. Four plants provided data from 2021 and one plant provided data from 2021-2022.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average vinyl ester resin production in the United States. Production data were collected from 4 producers (5 plants) in the United States. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data.","technologyDescription":"Vinyl ester resin is produced by the esterification of an epoxy resin with an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid (UMA). Methacrylic acid (also referred to as methyl methacrylate acid (MMA)) is the most common monocarboxylic acid used in vinyl ester resin production. Acrylic acid may also be used to manufacture vinyl ester resin. The epoxy resin and UMA are mixed in a reactor vessel and heated to initiate the esterification reaction and produce the vinyl ester monomer. Styrene is commonly used as a diluent in vinyl ester resin production to achieve the desired viscosity of the mixture. Following this step, a catalyst is added to the mixture and initiates the polymerization reaction between the epoxy groups of the resin and the carboxylic acid groups of the unsaturated acid, resulting in the formation of ester linkages. The reaction is exothermic and releases heat, so cooling systems are often used to maintain the optimal temperature for the reaction. The final vinyl ester resin product is shipped to composite fabricators via drum, tote, or bulk tankers where it is combined with other materials, such as fibers and fillers, and processed into a finished or semi-finished part. \r\n","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process.

The data collection methods for vinyl ester resin include information provided by direct measurement, purchasing and utility records, and engineering estimates. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the reporting companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop the vinyl ester resin average used in this LCA model.
