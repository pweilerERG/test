Phosgene, an incoming material in MDI production, is produced at the same plant as MDI, thus the collected LCI data could not be separated. Therefore, phosgene production is included in this dataset. The technical scope of this study is gate-to-gate and the system boundary includes incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes are included within this boundary. MDI formation consists of two steps. In the first, 4,4-methylenedianiline (MDA) is created as an intermediate by the condensation of aniline and formaldehyde in the presence of an acid. In the final step, MDA is phosgenated to produce MDI. A mixture of MDI, its dimer and trimer is formed, and referred to as polymeric MDI (PMDI). Pure MDI is distilled from the reaction mixture. Hydrochloric acid is created as a coproduct during this process. \r\n\r\nAll inputs and outputs between the two main coproducts, MDI and HCl, are allocated on the basis of mass.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"02.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2017-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data for this unit process were collected for the years 2015 or 2017. For the MDI primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of MDI production prior to the project initiation date. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. Three companies provided data for the year 2015, and one company provided data for the year 2017. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015-2017 was representative of an average year for MDI production at their company.  ","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average MDI production in North America. All MDI data collected were from 4 plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions), and Franklin Associates’ private database. Production data were aggregated and horizontally averaged across the four North American plants. The MDI producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American MDI production. The captured MDI production amount is approximately 90 percent of the MDI production in the U.S. in 2015.  ","technologyDescription":"The overall production technology is similar among all MDI plants that submitted data for this analysis. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate is manufactured by first producing intermediate products; diamines (MDA) and phosgene. Diamines are produced from aniline and formaldehyde reactions and phosgene is produced from carbon monoxide and chlorine gases. The intermediate products are then reacted to form a mixture of several MDI isomers. Purification of crude MDI is the final step in MDI manufacture.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process with mass allocation. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of MDI. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. Secondary supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.","completenessDescription":"Treatment of Missing Environmental Data: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Missing Technosphere Data: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMass Balance: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All MDI production data was sourced from primary producers. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average MDI datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"Boundary Conditions: The system boundary includes MDI manufacturing which is aggregated with phosgene and 4,4-methylenedianiline (MDA), and includes incoming transportation and upstream burdens for each material as well as process waste management.
