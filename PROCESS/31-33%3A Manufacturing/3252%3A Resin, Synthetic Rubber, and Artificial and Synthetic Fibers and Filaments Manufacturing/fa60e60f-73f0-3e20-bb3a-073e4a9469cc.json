The technical scope of this study is gate-to-gate and the system boundary includes incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes. Polybutadiene production can vary based on the source of butadiene, the modeled production pathway is through the dehydrogenation of n-butane or mixture of n-butanes and butenes followed by purification of butadiene and polymerization into polybutadiene using Ziegler-Natta catalysts. This dataset is from secondary sources, but it was reviewed and determined to be representative of polybutadiene production by a polybutadiene producer in 2006 and reviewed internally for the current study.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"02.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2003-12-31","timeDescription":"Butadiene input amount and air emissions/waterborne release data are from a 1996 EPA source (ERG 1996, Locating and Estimating Air Emissions from Sources of 1,3-Butadiene, EPA-454/R-96-008).
