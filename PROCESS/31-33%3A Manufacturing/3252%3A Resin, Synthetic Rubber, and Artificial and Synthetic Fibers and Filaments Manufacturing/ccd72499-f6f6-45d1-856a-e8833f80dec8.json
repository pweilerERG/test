{"@type":"Process","@id":"ccd72499-f6f6-45d1-856a-e8833f80dec8","name":"Pultruded product, at plant","description":"This gate-to-gate unit process represents the production of one kilogram of pultruded product manufactured in North America. The material inputs for pultrusion in this study are an average of the plants who provided data; as no one pultrusion plant would make a specific product using all of the materials shown. The studied unit process boundary includes elementary flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of pultruded products, and disposal of process wastes. Four pultruding companies provided data for this average dataset. The thermoset resins included in this analysis are vinyl ester resin, unsaturated polyester, and polyurethane resin, which is shown by the precursors mixed at the pultrusion plant. A variety of glass fibers (rovings and/or mat) may be used for fiber reinforcement, while potential fillers include limestone, aluminum trihydrate and clay. Styrene is sometimes used as a diluent used to lower the viscosity of the resin system during the pultrusion process.  Different catalysts and initiators were reported, but not included as they were smaller than the 1% of the output cut-off. This unit process includes cutoff flows that represent process waste disposal. Land use and land transformation are not included in this dataset. As these pultruding plants were considered as a whole, not focused on any one product; there are no coproducts in this unit process therefore no allocation was performed.

Data for the pultrusion of products were provided by four leading pultruding companies (4 plants) for 2021-2022 in North America. For the primary data collected, each producer was requested to provide data for a one year period that best represented their average production within a 2 year window (2021 through 2022). Three of the four producers chose 2021 to represent their data, while one company chose a partial year in 2021 with the remainder in 2022.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average pultruded product manufacture in North America. Production data were collected from 4 pultruding companies (4 plants) in North America. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data.","technologyDescription":"For the pultrusion process, fibers are pulled through a liquid resin bath until the fibers are sufficiently impregnated with the resin. Fillers may be added to the mixture to improve the strength and thermal stability of the resin. The coated fibers are then formed to the desired shape and pulled through a heated die to cure the resin. The pultruded composite product exits the die as a continuous profile with the desired-cross sectional shape.  As stated previously, the differences in input materials and output products may affect the amount of energy required and types of emissions that are produced during this process; however, the pultrusion technology is the same.

The data collection methods for pultruded products include information provided by direct measurement, purchasing and utility records, calculations from equipment specifications, and engineering estimates. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the reporting companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop the pultrusion average used in this LCA model.
