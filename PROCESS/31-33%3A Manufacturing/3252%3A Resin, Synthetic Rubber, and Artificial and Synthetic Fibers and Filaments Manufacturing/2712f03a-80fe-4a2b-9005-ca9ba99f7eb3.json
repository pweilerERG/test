The HDPE resin is commonly polymerized in low pressure reactors. The three main reactor types used are gas-phase, slurry loop, and solution reactors. Only the gas-phase and slurry loop reactors were stated as the representative technology by the data providers. Normally a combination of Phillips, Ziegler-Natta and/or metallocene catalysts are required during the process. The metal mining and processing for titanium (ZN catalyst) and chromium and silica gel used in the Phillips catalyst were included.

Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. Four companies provided data for the year 2015, and one company provided data for the year 2016. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015-2016 was representative of an average year for HDPE resin production at their company.  \r\n\r\nThe geographic scope of the analysis is the manufacture of HDPE resin in North America.

","completenessDescription":"Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset.

Small amounts (less than 1 percent of total output) of off-spec/scrap resin and isomers are produced as coproducts during this process and sold. A mass basis was used to allocate out the credit for the coproduct off-spec/scrap resin; thus, this inventory represents only the primary (i.e., virgin resin) produced. The average HDPE datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each HDPE data provider.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes manufacturing of HDPE resin at the plant, including incoming transportation for each material.\r\nDATA COLLECTION: The primary data for the life cycle inventory of the production of HDPE, were collected from five producers located in the United States and Canada in 2015-2016. A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the HDPE production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n\r\n","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected from 2015-2016","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"364cfe79-1913-4537-9482-b3aa9f269688","name":"Franklin Associates (2020).
