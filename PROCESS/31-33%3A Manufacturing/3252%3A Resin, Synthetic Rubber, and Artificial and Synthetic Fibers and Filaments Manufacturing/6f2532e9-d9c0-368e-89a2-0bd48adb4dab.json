{"@type":"Process","@id":"6f2532e9-d9c0-368e-89a2-0bd48adb4dab","name":"Toluene diisocyanate, TDI; at plant; mass alloc","description":"This gate-to-gate unit process represents the production of one kilogram of Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) produced in North America. The studied system boundary includes flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of TDI, and disposal of process wastes. TDI is made by phosgenation of toluene diamine (TDA). The TDI data for this module includes data for the production of dinitrotoluene (DNT), phosgene, and TDA which are incoming materials to TDI production. These incoming materials are included as one dataset due to fewer than the 3 companies providing data for the incoming material or the collected TDI data included the incoming material and could not be separated. Heat was exported as a coproduct for some producers. The energy amount for the exported heat was reported separately as a natural gas avoided product. \n\n\nA large amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced as a coproduct during TDI production. A mass basis was used to partition the credit between the two co-products, TDI and HCl. The coproduct amount for HCl is not shown due to confidentiality issues.\r\n","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":true,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2003-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of TDI production in 2003. Data for the production TDI were provided by three leading producers (3 plants) for 2003 in North America. In 2015, there were only 2 companies manufacturing TDI in North America; therefore, it was decided that the 2003 average data would be used in this update after comparing the data to current data provided by one manufacturer. Differences in data were minor overall, with the newer data having lower energy consumption likely due to better efficiency over the 12 year variation.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average TDI production in North America. Production data were collected from 3 producers in North America aggregated using horizontal averaging. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data. The TDI producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American TDI production. ","technologyDescription":"Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is made by phosgenation of toluene diamine (TDA). The diamine mixture is dissolved in chlorobenzenes and reacted with excess phosgene to produce the TDI. After phosgenation, the mixture is stripped from the solvent and separated by distillation. The excess phosgene is recycled. Most of the TDI used in flexible polyurethane foams is a mixture of the 2,4- and 2,6- isomers. The 80:20 mixture of 2,4-TDI and 2,6-TDI is the most important commercial product, but other mixtures are available.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of TDI. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements are not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"All TDI production data was sourced from primary producers. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontally weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average TDI datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average. A large amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced as a coproduct during TDI production. A mass basis was used to partition the credit between the two co-products, TDI and HCl.  This dataset has already been allocated thus no allocation factors are included in this model.","samplingDescription":"Data are from primary sources.
