All three companies provided data for the year 2015. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015 was representative of an average year for PVC resin production at their company.  \n\nThe geographic scope of the analysis is the manufacture of PVC resin in North America.  All PVC resin data collected were from plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database and Franklin Associates’ private database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions) or secondary sources.","technologyDescription":"All data providers used the suspension polymerization technology.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"LCI data for the production of PVC resin were collected from three producers (three plants) in North America – all in the United States. All companies provided data for the year 2015. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015 was representative of an average year for PVC resin production at their company. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-products.","completenessDescription":"Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset.\r\n\r\nDue to limited emission data availability, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data was used in place of collected data from EDC/VCM data collectors for the following emissions: vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, 111 trichloroethane (chloroform), methyl chloride, and dioxins. The Vinyl Institute provided the amount of EDC/VCM production in 2015. The Vinyl Institute also provided estimates for the percentage of each emission coming from the EDC/VCM production versus the PVC production. Dioxin amounts were calculated as Toxic Equivalent Values (TEQ).","dataSelectionDescription":"All PVC production data was sourced from primary producers.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. Small amounts (less than 1 percent of total output) of off-spec resin is produced as coproducts during this process. A mass basis was used to allocate the credit for the coproduct. The average PVC datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each PVC data provider.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The unit process boundary includes the manufacturing of PVC resin at the plant, including incoming transportation for each material.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION: The primary data for the life cycle inventory of the production of PVC resin were collected from three producers (three plants) located in the United States in 2015. A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent, as well as secondary data sources. Due to limited data availability, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data was used in place of collected data from EDC/VCM data collectors for the following emissions: vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, 111 trichloroethane (chloroform), methyl chloride, and dioxins. \r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the PVC resin production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected in 2015","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"29618824-45e8-40e9-abb0-0c56cc883b32","name":"Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Analysis of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resin.
