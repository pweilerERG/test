{"@type":"Process","@id":"1d7ac207-310f-3366-8f9c-e951b61d31ce","name":"Polyol ether, for rigid foam polyurethane production, at plant","description":"This cradle-to-gate system process represents the production of one kilogram of polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethane produced in North America. The studied system boundary includes elementary flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethane, and disposal of process wastes. The two producers that provided data for this average dataset stated that standard polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethane technology is used. Due to having fewer than three producers contribute data to this study, the data is presented as a system process to protect the confidentiality of the producers. This system process includes cutoff flows that represent process waste disposal. There are no coproducts in this system process therefore no allocation was performed for polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethane manufacturing. Land use and land transformation are not included in this dataset.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"LCI_RESULT","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2017-12-31","timeDescription":"This system process is representative of polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethane production from data collected in 2015 and 2017. For the primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of polyether polyol production prior to the project initiation date. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. One plant provided data for the year 2015, while the second plant provided data from 2017.","geographyDescription":"This system process is representative of average polyether polyol for frigid foam polyurethane production in North America. Production data were collected from 2 producers (2 plants) in the United States. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data.","technologyDescription":"The technology used to manufacture the polyether polyol used in rigid foam polyurethane production begins with the introduction of a potassium hydroxide catalyst to an initiator. In this analysis, sucrose was chosen as the initiator; however, glycerine and sorbitol are also common initiators used to produce polyether polyols for rigid foam polyurethane. This solution is then reacted with propylene oxide to form an intermediate. The catalyst is removed using an acid, which produces a salt that must be filtered. This acid amount is small and considered negligible in this analysis. Finally, the polyol is purified of side products and water through distillation.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and cradle to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance. During the flow mapping process, insignificant flows that did not have a surrogate in the federal elementary flow list were removed. These removed flows fall under the 1% cutoff. Land use and land transformation are not included in this dataset.\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements are not included in this system process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset. Due to having fewer than three producers contribute data to this study, the data is presented as a system process to protect the confidentiality of the producers.\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated during review of the unit process data.","dataSelectionDescription":"All polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes production data was sourced from primary producers. The data collection methods for polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes include information provided by direct measurement, purchasing and utility records, calculations from equipment specifications, and engineering estimates. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the reporting companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop the polyethyer polyol average used in this LCA model. The average polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider.","samplingDescription":"Data for the production of polyether polyol were provided by 2 leading producers (2 plants) in North America.","dataCollectionDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes upstream burdens from incoming materials, incoming fuel use, incoming transportation of materials, polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes manufacturing, and process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements. \r\nDATA COLLECTION: Data were collected from two polyether polyol for rigid foam polyurethanes manufacturers (two plants).\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Uncertainty was not calculated.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"f03a4d7f-32f6-48c1-95c0-80445c1a0e72","name":"American Chemistry Council, 2022, Polyether Polyol for Rigid Foam Polyurethanes"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The data providers reviewed their data and the average.

The target audience of this model includes LCA practitioners, industry, and the general public. This dataset has been accepted by the North American plastics/chemical industry and is intended for use as an industry average. An inventory of environmental emission flows are included to the extent that the producers provided; thus this system process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories.
