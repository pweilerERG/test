{"@type":"Process","@id":"ab334aaf-bfe1-3785-91c5-3de1dc34c01b","name":"Compression molding, rigid composites part, at plant","description":"For each kilogram of composite part fabrication, the amount of incoming corrugated box material is equivalent to that coming out of the process as it is purchased to be used as shipping packaging. An average of 0.0014 kg of rigid composite part scrap is produced for every kilogram of compression molded parts produced; this scrap is sold for recycling. The packaging inputs in this data set represent the average reported per kilogram of output across a range of products produced at manufacturing facilities. Because the solid wastes shown are of unknown types, these could include food wastes, office wastes, or packaging wastes from incoming tools/materials. The data providers could not expound on the source of these solid wastes. The difference in the mass balance likely lays here. Complete inventory data and metadata are shown in full in the final report, Life Cycle Inventory of Polymer Composites. The report is not publicly available. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi, Anne Marie Molen, and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACMA members. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
