The manufacture includes the manufacturing of subcomponents at other facilities and assembly at a central location in Guangzhou, China.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional.  ","modelingConstantsDescription":"Allocation rules: Materials were based on actual specifications.  Energy and fuels were allocated to products manufactured at the location based on their mass.\r\nSubstitution allocation: Substitution by close proxy ( data for similar processes were used for the components)","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING Environmental Data - all known elementary flows are included, so cutoff is \u003c1%\r\nTechnosphere flow data - Intermediate flows are cut-off at less than 1% (physical criteria).  Capital equipment used for manufacturing were not included.  \r\nNote that there were no significant emissions to air, soil, or water from the scanner assembly process.  No emissions were measured and estimnates could not be quantified, but were believed to be were well 0.1% of total emissions from the full cradle to gate process, so zero emissions were included.\r\nMass Balance - The mass of inputs (not including fuels) balances with the scanner output, so there is less than 1% difference.","dataSelectionDescription":"An attempt was made to include data for all inputs.  Primary data were used where available and the most representative secondary data were used where primary data were not available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were taken from precise engineering specifications specific to this unit process.  These data were then transformed into material and energy flows using the methodology described in Wood (2022) which is due to be released in July, 2022.  The Wood (2022) methodology, which is an ISO 14044 compliant LCA, was independent third party reviewed. \r\n\r\nSecondary data were taken from the ecoinvent 3.2 database (Wernet et al. 2016) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).  The data were global except where otherwise specified.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nThe system boundary includes: 1) the transport of raw materials to multiple manufacturing facilities where various subcomponents are produced; 2) the manufacture of subcomponents; 3) the transport of subcomponents to a different manufacturing plant for final assembly; 4) the assembly of subcomponents into a complete scanner; and 5) the transport of generated waste from the manufacturing facilities to a municipal solid waste landfill.

Other inputs (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) were calculated on the basis of quantity of input per kg of scanner produced.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nUncertainty was estimated based on engineering judgment.
