The system boundary includes: 1) the transport of raw materials to multiple manufacturing facilities where various subcomponents are produced; 2) the manufacture of subcomponents; 3) the transport of subcomponents to a different manufacturing plant for final assembly; 4) the assembly of subcomponents into a complete scanner; and 5) the transport of generated waste from the manufacturing facilities to a municipal solid waste landfill.  The following processes and life cycle phases fall outside of the system boundary: 1) packaging of the completed scanner; 2) all transport downstream of the assembly plant gate; 3) sale of product; 4) product use phase; and 5) end-of-life phase (including recycling).\r\n\r\nThe use of this unit process for the analysis of similar devices requires professional judgement based on the degree of similarity.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3341: Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-12-31","validUntil":"2019-05-29","timeDescription":"Primary data is valid from 2017 - 2019.

The manufacture includes the manufacturing of subcomponents at other facilities and assembly at a central location.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional.

Primary data was used where available and the most representative secondary data was used where primary data was not available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were taken from precise engineering specifications specific to this unit process.  These data were then transformed into material and energy flows using the methodology described in Wood (2019) which is due to be released in August, 2019.  The Wood (2019) methodology is almost identical to the methodology described in Wood (2012) which is an ISO 14044 compliant, peer-reviewed life cycle assessment report of three Kodak scanners (Kodak i2800; i2600; and i2400).\r\n\r\nSecondary data were taken from the ecoinvent 3.2 database (Wernet et al. 2016) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).
