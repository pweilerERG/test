Other inputs (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) were calculated on the basis of quantity of input per kg of scanner produced.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nUncertainty was estimated based on engineering judgment.  Material inputs had less uncertainty because they were based off of precise engineering specifications.  Other inputs  (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) had more uncertainty.
