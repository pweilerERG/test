Primary data was used where available and the most representative secondary data was used where primary data was not available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were taken from precise engineering specifications specific to this unit process.  These data were then transformed into material and energy flows using the methodology described in Wood (2021) which is due to be released in March, 2021.  The Wood (2021) methodology is almost identical to the methodology described in Wood (2012) which is an ISO 14044 compliant, peer-reviewed life cycle assessment report of three Kodak scanners (Kodak i2800; i2600; and i2400).\r\n\r\nSecondary data were taken from the ecoinvent 3.2 database (Wernet et al. 2016) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).
