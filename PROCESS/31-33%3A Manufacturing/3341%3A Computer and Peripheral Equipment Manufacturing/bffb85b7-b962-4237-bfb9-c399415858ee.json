The system boundary includes: 1) the transport of raw materials to multiple manufacturing facilities where various subcomponents are produced; 2) the manufacture of subcomponents; 3) the transport of subcomponents to a different manufacturing plant for final assembly; 4) the assembly of subcomponents into a complete scanner; and 5) the transport of generated waste from the manufacturing facilities to a municipal solid waste landfill.  The following processes and life cycle phases fall outside of the system boundary: 1) packaging of the completed scanner; 2) all transport downstream of the assembly plant gate; 3) sale of product; 4) product use phase; and 5) end-of-life phase (including recycling).\r\n\r\nThe use of this unit process for the analysis of similar devices requires professional judgement based on the degree of similarity.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3341: Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-30","validUntil":"2020-11-30","timeDescription":"Primary data is valid from 2019 - 2020.

The manufacture includes the manufacturing of subcomponents at other facilities and assembly at a central location.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional.  ","modelingConstantsDescription":"Allocation rules: Materials were based on actual specifications.  Energy and fuels were allocated to products manufactured at the location based on their mass.\r\nSubstitution allocation: Substitution by close proxy ( data for similar processes were used for the components)","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING Environmental Data - all known elementary flows are included, so cutoff is \u003c1%\r\nTechnosphere flow data - Intermediate flows are cut-off at less than 1% (physical criteria).  Capital equipment used for manufacturing are not included.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE - The mass of inputs (not including fuels) balances with the scanner output, so there is less than 1% difference.","dataSelectionDescription":"An attempt was made to include data for all inputs.  Primary data was used where available and the most representative secondary data was used where primary data was not available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were taken from precise engineering specifications specific to this unit process.  These data were then transformed into material and energy flows using the methodology described in Wood (2019) which is due to be released in August, 2019.  The Wood (2019) methodology is almost identical to the methodology described in Wood (2012) which is an ISO 14044 compliant, peer-reviewed life cycle assessment report of three Kodak scanners (Kodak i2800; i2600; and i2400).\r\n\r\nSecondary data were taken from the ecoinvent 3.2 database (Wernet et al. 2016) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).

Other inputs (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) were calculated on the basis of quantity of input per kg of scanner produced.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nUncertainty was estimated based on engineering judgment.  Material inputs had less uncertainty because they were based off of precise engineering specifications.  Other inputs  (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) had more uncertainty.
