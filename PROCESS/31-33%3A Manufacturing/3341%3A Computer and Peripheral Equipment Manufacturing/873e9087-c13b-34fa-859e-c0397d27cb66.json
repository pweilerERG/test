Scanner scans at 120 A4 images per minute.  Use can exceed 10,000 images per day. This cradle to gate data was extracted from a full cradle to end of life LCA. Internal company validation via business and peer review and internal assessment. This dataset was consistent with LCA conducted using same approach as the office scanner LCA, which was peer reviewed by Kate Winnebeck, LCACP, New York State Pollution Prevention Institute , Rochester Institute of Technology.  Data is only directly representative for the scanner model i2900.  However components and manufacturing process is similar for many scanners, so extrapolation to other similar scanners may be done using judement.  Component proxy data for original LCA was from Ecoinvent. Each flow represents one or more parts made with the same materials and processes, which were aggregated The scanner was manufactured in China with the subcomponents mostly from China. However the best available datasets were used as proxy data and the best data often came from different geographic locations.  Some data was replaced in this cradle to gate dataset by USLCI data where appropriate data was available. Unless otherwise noted in a General Comment for individual flows, data described as dummy_ was from Ecoinvent.  Waste scrap was 0.5% of input flows.  Although these were included in the full LCA, they were not shown to be significant in the modeling and according to a 1% cutoff criteria, have not been included in this cradle to gate data.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3341: Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-06-09","validUntil":"2012-09-14","timeDescription":"start date was based on earliest date of secondary data.
