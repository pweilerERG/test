This process includes galvanized sheet as the metal feedstock.  Raw materials include all known pre-treatments, cleaners, paints, and packaging materials to protect the finished sheets--as well as inbound transport.  Manufacturing processes require electricity, heat from natural gas, and process water.  Air and water emissions are captured in the output of the process.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3328: Coating, Engraving, Heat Treating, and Allied Activities","version":"00.00.006","lastChange":"2023-10-23T16:07:41.378Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-12-31","validUntil":"2015-02-27","geographyDescription":"North America","technologyDescription":"Coil coating of galvanized steel sheet.
