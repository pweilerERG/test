{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa3871c0-d563-3300-9ec7-f26aafdabfa5","name":"Propylene oxide, at plant","description":"This gate-to-gate unit process represents the production of one kilogram of propylene oxide produced in North America. The studied system boundary includes elementary flows associated with upstream raw material extraction and processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of propylene oxide, and disposal of process wastes. This dataset is a weighted average of three technologies based on an estimated 2020 production capacity: chlorohydrin (50 percent), isobutene hydroperoxidation (33.9 percent), and ethylbenzene hydroperoxidation (16.1 percent). Newer technologies such as hyperoxidation using cumene hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide make up approximately 10 percent of the technology use but data was unavailable for these processes so these were excluded from this dataset. The energy, environmental emissions and raw materials for all three technologies included are based on datasets from a confidential secondary source from 1992. Energy requirement data for the two peroxidation technologies from a Department of Energy (DOE) report (US DOE, 2000) were used to check the older data. This unit process includes a cutoff flow that represents process waste disposal. In the two hydroperoxidation datasets, coproduct credit was given on a mass basis. \r\n\r\nAn excess amount of brine water is produced during one of the technologies but is not presented as an output to nature; these output amounts would likely explain the inconsistency in the mass balance shown for this hybrid technology inventory.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1992-01-01","validUntil":"1992-12-31","timeDescription":"The energy, environmental emissions and raw materials data for the three technologies used for propylene oxide production in this dataset are representative of production from 1992. Energy data from a 2000 DOE report which is based on 1997 data were used to validate the older data.","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of propylene oxide produced in the United States.","technologyDescription":"Three propylene oxide production technologies are included in this dataset: chlorohydrin, isobutene hydroperoxidation, and ethylbenzene.\r\n\r\nThe chlorohydrin process begins with an equal molar mixture of propylene and chlorine in water, which forms the solution propylene chlorohydrin. The chlorohydrin solution is treated with a base, usually cell liquor from a chlorine plant, to form the oxide. Propylene oxide is then stripped from the alkaline solution and purified by distilling the light ends, then the oxide.\r\n\r\nIn the isobutene hydroperoxide process, propylene oxide and tert-butyl alcohol are formed from isobutene, oxygen, and propylene. Isobutane is first oxidized to the intermediate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide. This intermediate and an alcohol mixture coproduct is combined with propylene. This is reacted to nearly 100 percent conversion of the hydroperoxide over a catalyst. The products stream contains propylene oxide and tert-butyl alcohol. The products are separated in distillation columns.\r\n\r\nIn the ethylbenzene hydroperoxide reaction, propylene oxide and styrene are produced. Ethylbenzene and oxygen are reacted to form ethylbenzene hydroperoxide and small amounts of methylbenzyl alcohol and acetophenone. This solution and propylene are fed to the epoxidation reactor. The products stream contains propylene oxide, propylene, methylbenzyl alcohol, and small amounts of several other hydrocarbons. Propylene oxide is purified by a multi-tower distillation scheme.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Confidential secondary data were used to model the production of propylene oxide. The propylene oxide data is an average of three different technologies from the 1990s. The technologies are all still in use in North America, and the weightings of each dataset have been updated to reflect recent use of these technologies. All data collected were carefully evaluated and reviewed.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements are not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance for this process was calculated. An excess amount of brine water is produced during one of the technologies but is not presented as an output to nature; these output amounts would likely explain the inconsistency in the mass balance shown for this hybrid inventory.","dataSelectionDescription":"All propylene oxide production data was sourced from a confidential secondary source and reviewed.
