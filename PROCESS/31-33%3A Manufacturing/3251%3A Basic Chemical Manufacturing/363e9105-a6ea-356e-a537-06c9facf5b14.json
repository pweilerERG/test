{"@type":"Process","@id":"363e9105-a6ea-356e-a537-06c9facf5b14","name":"Aniline; at plant","description":"The functional unit for this model is one kilogram of aniline. This aniline dataset includes nitrobenzene production and has been aggregated with incoming nitric acid LCI data. The technical scope includes the gate-to-gate production of nitric acid, nitrobenzene, and aniline. The system boundary includes incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes. The aniline dataset represented in this model includes data for nitric acid to conceal the confidential data of a provider company. Steam/heat is produced as a coproduct during this process, so system expansion is used for this recovered energy, which is shown as natural gas as an avoided product. Aniline is formed by the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the presence of a copper-chromium or copper-silica catalyst. The aniline producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American aniline production. The captured aniline production amount is approximately 71 percent of the aniline production in the U.S. in 2015.  ","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"02.01.001","lastChange":"2024-07-31T14:20:32.380Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2016-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of aniline production from 2015-2016. Secondary data supporting the modeling are from 1990 and were adapted to represent updated nitric acid production. For the nitrobenzene/aniline primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of aniline production prior to the project initiation date. Data for the production of nitrobenzene/aniline were provided by two leading production plants in North America. Nitric acid data was included to keep the data confidential. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. One company provided data for the year 2015, and one company provided data for the year 2016. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015-2016 was representative of an average year for aniline production at their company.  ","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average aniline production in North America. Production data were collected from 2 leading producers in the United States and aggregated using horizontal averaging. Incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions), and Franklin Associates’ private database. The energy and emissions data for nitric acid production is from a primary European source from 1990 and was adapted to North American conditions.","technologyDescription":"The overall production technology is similar among all aniline plants that submitted data for this analysis. Aniline is formed by the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the presence of a copper-chromium or copper-silica catalyst. For hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, preheated hydrogen and nitrobenzene are fed into an evaporator, and aniline is formed by vapor phase catalytic reduction. The aniline is dehydrated to remove the water produced during the reaction. Pure aniline (99.95 wt. %) is obtained after a purification step in which the dehydrated aniline goes through a distillation process.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of nitrobenzene/aniline. Nitric acid data were collected from a European source from 1990. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. Secondary supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.","completenessDescription":"Treatment of Missing Environmental Data: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Missing Technosphere Data: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and support personnel requirements not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMass Balance: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All nitrobenzene/aniline production data were sourced from primary producers. Primary data were used for nitric acid production from a 1990 European source and adapted for North American production. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their data and the average dataset as needed. The nitric acid data was collected in the 1990s and was compared to similar European data (from a 1997 secondary source). One potential data gap is the release of nitrous oxide from nitric acid production. No data was provided on the release of nitrous oxide in the private data from 1990s; whereas the 1997 secondary source includes an amount of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide may affect some impact categories, including global warming potential.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average aniline datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"Boundary Conditions: The system boundary includes aniline production which is aggregated with nitrobenzene and nitric acid, and includes incoming transportation and upstream burdens for each material as well as process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and support personnel requirements. \r\n\r\nData Collection: Data were collected from aniline manufacturers.\r\n\r\nUncertainty Estimation: Uncertainty was not calculated.","dataCollectionDescription":"Nitrobenzene/aniline data were collected from 2015-2016.
