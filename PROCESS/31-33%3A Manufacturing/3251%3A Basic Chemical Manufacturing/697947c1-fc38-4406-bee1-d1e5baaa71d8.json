{"@type":"Process","@id":"697947c1-fc38-4406-bee1-d1e5baaa71d8","name":"Hydrogen; small scale-steam methane reforming; at plant","description":"This cradle to gate unit process is for 1 kilogram of hydrogen produced from small-scale steam methane reforming. This model is based on European primary data but has been adapted to represent US conditions. Data were collected by Schreiber et al., 2020 from process designs and simulations and have been adapted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The output of this system is syngas which is composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, a stoichiometric (molar mass) allocation was used to allocate between hydrogen and carbon monoxide (2:1). The system boundary of this dataset includes the reforming process and incoming materials with transportation and excludes carbon dioxide from direct air capture and the syngas separation process. Steam is an avoided product in this dataset. The amount of avoided steam was calculated based on the output flow rate of syngas.  It is important to note that this model represents a small-scale steam methane reforming process (8,760 h load per year) which may use different technologies and be less efficient than a large scale process.

This study was originally conducted under European conditions using small-scale steam methane reforming process designs and simulations. The technology for the steam methane reforming process is similar in Europe and the US.","technologyDescription":"This process represents the production of hydrogen using small-scale steam methane reforming with a stoichiometric allocation between hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The process includes the reforming process but excludes the direct air capture of carbon dioxide. The process design of the small-scale steam methane reforming was carried out by a private company. Typical heat integration and process set-up designs were used. The process design is adapted to obtain syngas in a hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio of two from a small-scale steam methane reforming for hydrogen production. Energy efficiency is 10% lower for small-scale steam methane reforming plants than large-scale plants.
