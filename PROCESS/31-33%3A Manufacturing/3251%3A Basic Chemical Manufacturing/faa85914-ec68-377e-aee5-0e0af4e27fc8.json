Per the Chemical Economics Handbook, SRI Consulting, 2011, the production mix data module assigns 96.5% of chlorine and caustic soda production to diaphragm/membrane cell electrolysis and 3.5% to mercury cathode cell electrolysis. This data module for average production assigns 96.5 percent of chlorine and caustic soda production to diaphragm/membrane cell electrolysis and 3.5 percent of chlorine and caustic soda production to mercury cathode cell electrolysis.  The collected datasets were weighted using these fractions.  Co-product credit is given because sodium hydroxide and a small amount of hydrogen are produced when chlorine is produced from salt using an electrolytic cell.  Mass imbalance is due to unavailability of the weight of water inputs to production.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and this module due to rounding. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
