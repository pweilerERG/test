All three companies provided data for the year 2015. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015 was representative of an average year for EDC/VCM production at their company.  \n\nThe geographic scope of the analysis is the manufacture of PVC resin in North America.  All PVC resin data collected were from plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database and Franklin Associates’ private database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions) or secondary sources.","technologyDescription":"All data providers used the production of ethylene dichloride (EDC) by direct chlorination and oxychlorination, as well as the  thermal cracking of EDC to make vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"LCI data for the production of EDC/VCM were collected from three producers (three plants) in North America – all in the United States. All companies provided data for the year 2015. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015 was representative of an average year for EDC/VCM production at their company. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-product.","completenessDescription":"Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset. \r\n\r\n\r\nDue to limited emission data availability, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data was used in place of collected data from EDC/VCM data collectors for the following emissions: vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, 111 trichloroethane (chloroform), methyl chloride, and dioxins. The Vinyl Institute provided the amount of EDC/VCM production in 2015. The Vinyl Institute also provided estimates for the percentage of each emission coming from the EDC/VCM production versus the PVC production. Dioxin amounts were calculated as Toxic Equivalent Values (TEQ).","dataSelectionDescription":"All EDC/VCM production data was sourced from primary producers.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. Only a small amount (less than 1 percent of total output) of chemical coproduct is produced as a coproduct during the EDC product. A mass basis was used to allocate the credit for the coproduct. Although some chemicals are produced as by-products of the VCM production, they are used within the EDC/VCM plant and not considered a coproduct. The average EDC/VCM datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The unit process boundary includes the manufacturing of EDC and VCM at the plant, including incoming transportation for each material.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION: The primary data for the life cycle inventory of the production of EDC/VCM were collected from three producers (three plants) located in the United States in 2015. A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent, as well as secondary data sources. Due to limited data availability, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data was used in place of collected data from EDC/VCM data collectors for the following emissions: vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, 111 trichloroethane (chloroform), methyl chloride, and dioxins. \r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the EDC/VCM production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected in 2015","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"29618824-45e8-40e9-abb0-0c56cc883b32","name":"Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Analysis of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resin.
