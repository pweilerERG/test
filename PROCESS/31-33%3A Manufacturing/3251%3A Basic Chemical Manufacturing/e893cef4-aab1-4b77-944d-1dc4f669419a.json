Crude terephthalic acid is manufactured primarily by the oxidation of paraxylene in the liquid phase. Liquid paraxylene, acetic acid, and a catalyst, such as manganese or cobalt bromides, are combined as the liquid feed to the oxidizers. The temperature of this exothermic reaction is maintained at about 200° C (Lloyd, 2011). The pressure may range from 300 to 400 psi.\r\n\r\nReactor effluents are continuously removed from the reactor and routed to a series of crystallizers, where they are cooled by flashing the liquids. The partially oxidized impurities are more soluble in acetic acid and tend to remain in solution, while crude TPA crystallizes from the liquor.\r\n\r\nThe slurry from the crystallizers is sent to solid/liquid separators, where crude TPA is recovered in the solids. The liquid portion is distilled and acetic acid, methyl acetate, and water are recovered overhead. Acetic acid is removed from the solution and recycled back to the oxidizer.\r\n\r\nThe purification of crude TPA involves the hydrogenation of the crude TPA over a palladium-containing catalyst at about 450°F. High-purity TPA is recrystallized from a high-pressure water solution of the hydrogenated material.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the reclaimer processes used to produce the recycled resins.
