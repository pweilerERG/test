Two of the three companies provided data for the year 2015, with the remaining providing 2017 data. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified their data was representative of an average year for Chlor-alkali production at their company.  \n\nThe geographic scope of the analysis is the manufacture of hydrogen using the membrane technology in North America.  All chlor-alkali data collected were from plants in the United States and incoming material (sodium chloride in brine) was modeled using ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions).","technologyDescription":"All data providers used the membrane technology to produce chlorine, as well as sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. Membrane cell electrolysis is the most recent of the Chlor-alkali technologies. The membrane cell is named as such since the anode and cathodes are separated by a perfluoropolymer cation exchange membrane. Saturated brine solution is passed through the anode compartment of the cell, where the chloride ions are oxidized into chlorine gas.  The electric field causes sodium ions to pass through the membrane to the cathode.  Due to the oxidation of the water, hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions form and produce sodium hydroxide at the cathode. According to The Chlorine Institute, \" membrane electrolyzers typically produce 30% to 35% sodium hydroxide,\" which is then concentrated using evaporators. A 50% solution is typical from this process and is a co-product in the Chlor-alkali process. Hydrogen can be captured for use as a fuel or material input, sold as a coproduct, or released to the air depending on the chlor-alkali plant.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"LCI data for the production of hydrogen from the Chlor-alkali process were collected from three producers (three plants) in North America – all in the United States. Two companies provided data for the year 2015, while one provided data from the year 2017. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from the year for which they provided data was representative of an average year for Chlro-alkali production at their company. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-product with the following exceptions:  \n •\tThe sodium chloride input was given stoichiometric allocation among the three products. As the plants providing data produced for sale only chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, the sodium chloride input was split between the chlorine and sodium hydroxide using the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction. \n•\tThe sulfuric acid input was used specifically to dry the chlorine and so has fully been allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll chlorine-based air emissions or waterborne wastes are allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll sodium hydroxide emissions are allocated to the sodium hydroxide product.\n•\tAll hydrogen emissions are allocated to the hydrogen product.","completenessDescription":"Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset.","dataSelectionDescription":"All Chlor-alkali production data was sourced from primary producers.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. Three main coproducts (chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen) are produced during the Chlor-alkali process and allocation was performed after the average was created. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-product with the following exceptions:  \n •\tThe sodium chloride input was given stoichiometric allocation among the three products. As the plants providing data produced for sale only chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, the sodium chloride input was split between the chlorine and sodium hydroxide using the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction. \n•\tThe sulfuric acid input was used specifically to dry the chlorine and so has fully been allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll chlorine-based air emissions or waterborne wastes are allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll sodium hydroxide emissions are allocated to the sodium hydroxide product.\n•\tAll hydrogen emissions are allocated to the hydrogen product. \nAlthough some chemicals are produced within the chlor-alkali plant (e.g. hydrochloric acid), they are not considered a coproduct. The average chlor-alkali dataset was reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The unit process boundary includes the manufacturing of hydrogen at the chlor-alkali plant, including incoming transportation for each material.\n\nDATA COLLECTION: The primary data for the life cycle inventory of the production of chlor-alkali were collected from three producers (three plants) located in the United States in 2015 \u0026 2017. A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent, as well as secondary data sources.\n\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the hydrogen production from the chlor-alkali process. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected for 2015 or 2017.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"29618824-45e8-40e9-abb0-0c56cc883b32","name":"Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Analysis of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resin.
