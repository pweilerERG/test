The technical scope of this study is gate-to-gate and the system boundary includes incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes. This dataset represents HCl as a coproduct of MDI production under the hybrid allocation method. The hybrid method uses a mix of mass and elemental allocation to allocate all inputs and outputs. Under this allocation method the chlorine input is fully allocated to the production of HCl and the inputs used to create MDA and phosgene are allocated fully to MDI. Chlorine and chlorine-based atmospheric emissions or waterborne releases are fully allocated to HCl and all other MDI inputs/outputs have been given mass allocation.

For the MDI primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of MDI production prior to the project initiation date. Companies providing data were given the option to collect data from the year preceding or following 2015 if either year would reflect more typical production conditions. Three companies provided data for the year 2015, and one company provided data for the year 2017. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015-2017 was representative of an average year for MDI production at their company.  ","geographyDescription":"This unit process is representative of average HCl production from MDI manufacturing in North America. All MDI data collected were from 4 plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions), and Franklin Associates’ private database. Production data were aggregated and horizontally averaged across the four North American plants. The MDI producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American MDI production. The captured MDI production amount is approximately 90 percent of U.S. MDI production in 2015.","technologyDescription":"The overall production technology for the production of HCl from MDI manufacturing is similar across all plants used in this analysis. MDI and HCl are manufactured by first producing intermediate products; diamines (MDA) and phosgene. Diamines are produced from aniline and formaldehyde reactions and phosgene is produced from carbon monoxide and chlorine gases. The intermediate products are then reacted to form a mixture of several MDI isomers. Purification of crude MDI is the final step in MDI manufacture. The material coproduct from MDI production includes a sizable amount of hydrochloric acid.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of MDI and HCl. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. Secondary supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.","completenessDescription":"Treatment of Missing Environmental Data: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Missing Technosphere Data: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMass Balance: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All MDI and HCl production data was sourced from primary producers. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average MDI/HCl datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"Boundary Conditions: The system boundary includes MDI and HCl manufacturing which is aggregated with phosgene and 4,4-methylenedianiline (MDA), and includes incoming transportation and upstream burdens for each material as well as process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements. \r\n\r\nData Collection: Data were collected from MDI manufacturers. \r\n\r\nUncertainty Estimation: Uncertainty was not calculated.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected for the years 2015 or 2017.","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"603de97d-d877-45eb-97a8-3fac2064d1c0","name":"American Chemistry Council, 2022, MDI"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The data providers reviewed their data and the average.
