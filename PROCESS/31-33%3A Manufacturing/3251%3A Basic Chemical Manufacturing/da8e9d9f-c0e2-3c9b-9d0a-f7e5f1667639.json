Data for this process is mainly drawn from Reynolds, 2006 (aka DAI, 2006). It is assumed that the DAI report covers the transport the ethanol to the blending terminal (the \"destination\" of the report); distance for the subsequent transport to refueling station is included in this process as the author\u0027s own estimate. In the modeling of ethanol distribution, the transport of E10 and E85 to the refueling station is counted separately for each component (denatured ethanol and petrol/gasoline). Transport of the ethanol is included in this step; transport of gasoline is accounted by using the ecoinvent \"petrol, at regional storage\" process which includes transport to refueling station as well as the operation of the refueling station. The process of blending (and its energy use) is included in separate processes, as well as the infrastructure for additional terminals and blending apparatus, \"E10, at blending terminal\" and \"E85, at blending terminal\". Infrastructure for refueling stations are included in the processes \"E10, pumped into vehicle\" and \"E85, pumped into vehicle.\"  [Infrastructure for additional transportation equipment required to distribute EISA volumes of ethanol is NOT included in this process since we are using the ecoinvent \"transport\" process which includes infrastructure.] \nThe production of ethanol utilized in this process assigns inputs to co-products (e.g., wheat kernals and straw, corn grain and stover) based on activities and inputs that are required for the growth and harvest and preprocessing of, e.g., wheat straw, and none that of the activities or inputs that would normally be used to produce, harvest and preprocess, e.g., wheat kernals (so-called \"incremental allocation\").","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.00.005","lastChange":"2023-03-31T19:04:04.615Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-12-31","validUntil":"2021-12-31","timeDescription":"2022","geographyDescription":"North America","technologyDescription":"Modern","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
