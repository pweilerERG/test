{"@type":"Process","@id":"136cbdd8-ef76-3834-904d-6fce42b2b660","name":"Ethylene oxide, at plant","description":"This cradle-to-gate system process represents the production of one kilogram of ethylene oxide produced in North America. The studied system boundary includes elementary flows associated with upstream raw material procurement, intermediate material processing, incoming transport, manufacturing of ethylene oxide, and disposal of process wastes. Incoming materials include ethylene, oxygen, and nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is produced in plants that manufacture several other products within the same unit. Some plants were not able to separate the ethylene oxide emissions from the other processes manufactured at the ethylene oxide plant and so ethylene oxide emissions may be minorly overstated. These data include a weighted average of 2 ethylene oxide producers with 4 plants in the U.S. from 2015. This dataset is presented as a system process because fewer than three producers provided data. This system process includes cutoff flows that represent process waste disposal. There are no coproducts in this unit process so no allocation was performed for ethylene oxide manufacturing.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"LCI_RESULT","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2015-12-31","timeDescription":"This system process is representative of ethylene oxide production from 2015. For the primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of ethylene oxide production prior to the project initiation date. Four plants (two producers) provided data for the year 2015. \r\n\r\nIncoming material data were collected at various times: ethylene primary data were collected for the year 2015, oxygen primary data were collected from 1990-1993, and nitrogen data were adapted from a 2007 secondary source.","geographyDescription":"This system process is representative of average ethylene oxide in North America. Production data were collected from 2 producers (4 plants) in the United States and aggregated using horizontal averaging. Incoming materials were modeled using North American data.","technologyDescription":"The primary production method for ethylene oxide is the direct, vapor-phase oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen over a catalyst at a high temperature and pressure. The predominant feed for commercial oxidation processes is oxygen rather than air due to higher yields and less downtime. While most manufacturers of ethylene oxide purchase the oxygen needed in the reaction, some plants pull oxygen from air separation on-site. The ethylene oxide is catalyzed by silver and is exothermic. Oil or boiling water is used to absorb the heat in a multi-tubular catalytic reactor and produce steam that is used in other parts of the process. The products of the reaction are fed to an ethylene oxide absorber for lights removal by water quenching. Part of the gaseous stream is recycled into the multi-tubular reactor, while the other part is sent to a CO2 removal unit consisting of an absorber and a stripper. Because of its special molecular structure, ethylene oxide easily precipitates in the addition reaction and can easily polymerize into larger compounds.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and cradle to gate system process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of ethylene oxide. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance. Some plants were not able to separate the ethylene oxide emissions from the other processes manufactured at the ethylene oxide plant and so ethylene oxide emissions may be minorly overstated.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements are not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated.","dataSelectionDescription":"All ethylene oxide production data was sourced from primary producers. The data collection methods for ethylene oxide include information provided by direct measurement, purchasing and utility records, calculations from equipment specifications, and engineering estimates. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the reporting companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset as needed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A horizontal weighted average was calculated from the data collected to develop this LCA model. The average ethylene oxide datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes upstream burdens from incoming materials (ethylene, oxygen, and nitrogen), incoming transportation of materials, ethylene oxide manufacturing, and process waste management. The following are excluded from the system boundary: miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements. \r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION: Data were collected from two ethylene oxide manufacturers (four plants).\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Uncertainty was not calculated.","dataCollectionDescription":"All ethylene oxide primary data were collected for the year 2015.

This dataset has been accepted by the North American plastics/chemical industry and is intended for use as an industry average.
