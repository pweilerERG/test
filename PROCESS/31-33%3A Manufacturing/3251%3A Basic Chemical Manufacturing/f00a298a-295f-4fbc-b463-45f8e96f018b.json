The original model was based on German data but has been adapted to represent US conditions. Data were originally collected by Bareiß et al., 2019 and have been adapted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The system boundary of this dataset includes incoming materials and process energy but excludes the anode drying and purification system. Hydrogen and oxygen are produced from this process but oxygen is not assigned co-product credit in this model as it is not used. If oxygen were to be used, the anode drying and purification system would be required.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2017-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of 2017 data collected from a study that was published in 2019.

LCA studies with this intended application offer \"purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g., a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy.” The studies categorized under Goal Situation C1 do NOT consider existing benefits outside the analyzed system such as recycling. The target audience of this dataset is LCA practitioners, industry, the general public, and policymakers.
