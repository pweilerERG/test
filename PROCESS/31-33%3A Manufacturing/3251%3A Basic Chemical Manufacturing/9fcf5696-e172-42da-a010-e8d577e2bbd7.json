This analysis considers the production from the catalytic reforming of naphtha from a refinery.   \r\n\r\nThe reforming processes are used to convert paraffinic hydrocarbon streams into aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Catalytic reforming uses catalysts, such as platinum and palladium, to dehydrogenate straight-run light naphtha to yield a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons (Cheremisinoff, 2009). The hydrogen that is removed during dehydrogenation is used during the hydrocracking process and reduces coke formation. \r\n\r\nThe BTX aromatics are then extracted from the reformate and fractionated to separate streams using distillation. Adsorption or crystallization may be used as well to separate the aromatic streams. \r\nTotal energy data for mixed xylenes were provided by a confidential source in the previous analysis from 2011. The mix of fuels for energy and estimated transport data was reviewed and revised from discussions with a current producer in 2018. Carbon dioxide emissions were estimated from the PlasticsEurope BTX EcoProfile report (PlasticsEurope, 2013).","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-12-31","validUntil":"2016-11-30","timeDescription":"","geographyDescription":"","technologyDescription":"Mixed Xylenes are produced from the catalytic reforming of naphtha from a refinery.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional.

Carbon dioxide emissions were estimated from the PlasticsEurope BTX EcoProfile report. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION:  All data received were carefully discussed with current producer(s) and evaluated before compiling the update to the existing data sets, used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n","dataCollectionDescription":"Updated energy and transportation data is from 2018 other inputs are from 2011 which were a compination of primary data from a producer and secondary data.
