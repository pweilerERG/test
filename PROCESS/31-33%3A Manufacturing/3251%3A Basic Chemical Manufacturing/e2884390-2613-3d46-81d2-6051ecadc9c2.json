{"@type":"Process","@id":"e2884390-2613-3d46-81d2-6051ecadc9c2","name":"Styrene; at plant","description":"The functional unit for this model is one kilogram of styrene. This styrene dataset includes the production of the amount of ethylbenzene required to produce 1 kg of styrene. The system boundary includes the gate-to-gate production of ethylbenzene and styrene. Incoming transport, manufacturing, and disposal of process wastes are included within this boundary. Ethylbenzene is produced by the alkylation of benzene with ethylene. Styrene is then produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Toluene or a benzene/toluene mix are produced as coproduct streams during this process. A mass basis was used to partition the credit for these coproducts. Primary data were collected from an ethylbenzene/styrene manufacturer in 2015, this dataset was compared to the previously collected 2002-2003 data and the differences between the dataset were considered not significantly different statistically so the data was averaged with the 2002-2003 data to form this dataset. The styrene producer who provided 2015 data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of North American styrene production.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","version":"02.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2015-12-29","timeDescription":"This ethylbenzene/styrene unit process data was updated using one dataset collected in 2015 and averaging it with two 2002-2003 datasets used in the previous dataset and report.","geographyDescription":"This unit process data is representative of average ethylbenzene/styrene production in North America. All data collected were from 3 plants in the United States and incoming materials were modeled using North American databases such as the U.S. LCI database, ecoinvent (adapted to US conditions), and Franklin Associatesâ€™ private database. The producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American ethylbenzene/styrene production.","technologyDescription":"The overall technology is similar among all styrene plants that submitted data for this analysis. The production of the styrene monomer is accomplished through a series of processes including ethylbenzene production and the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The first is the production of ethylbenzene by the alkylation of benzene with ethylene. In this process, benzene initially passes through a drying column. From the drying column, the benzene and ethylene are mixed in a reactor with a suitable catalyst. This reaction is exothermic and occurs at relatively low pressures and temperatures. Unreacted benzene is removed and recycled back to the process. The ethylbenzene is then separated from the solution. The heavy bottoms, tars, and vent gases are burned while the solution is recycled back to the reactor.\r\n\r\nStyrene is produced by dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The ethylbenzene is mixed with steam, then allowed to come in contact with a catalyst in a reactor. This reaction is conducted at high temperature under vacuum. The heat is recovered from this reaction, and the hydrocarbon solution is sent to a series of fractionation units. The first separation removes the small amount (4 to 6 percent) of toluene and benzene produced by cracking. This toluene/benzene stream is typically sent back to the benzene plant. The second separation removes unreacted ethylbenzene and recycles it back into the system. Purified styrene monomer is recovered in the third and final phase. Bottoms or tar residue is removed from this third phase.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional and gate to gate process. Developed with the intention to be compatible with TRACI.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Primary data were used to model the production of ethylbenzene and styrene. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. Secondary supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.","completenessDescription":"Treatment of Missing Environmental Data: Elementary and technosphere flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Missing Technosphere Data: Miscellaneous materials and additives, capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, space conditioning, and support personnel requirements not included in this unit process. No gaps have been identified in this dataset.\r\n\r\nMass Balance: The mass balance for each individual plant was calculated. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All ethylbenzene/styrene production data was sourced from primary producers. Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and reliable material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged dataset was also reviewed by the current providing company as compared to the provided dataset. That company also reviewed whether their data were complete and commented about their or the average dataset. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"Only one producer provided ethylbenzene/styrene data for the year 2015. This data was compared to the previously collected 2 datasets representing 2002/2003 production data and found to be similar. A horizontal average was then calculated from these 3 datasets. To indicate known emissions while protecting the confidentiality of individual company responses, some emissions are reported only by the order of magnitude of the average.","samplingDescription":"Boundary Conditions: The system boundary includes ethylbenzene/styrene manufacturing, and includes incoming transportation and upstream burdens for each material as well as process waste management.
