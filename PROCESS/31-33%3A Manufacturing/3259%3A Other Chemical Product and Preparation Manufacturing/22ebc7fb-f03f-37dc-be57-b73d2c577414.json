Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used","modelingConstantsDescription":"Some recycled PET is sold in the form of resin pellets. The additional energy required to convert 1,000 pounds of recycled PET flake to resin pellets is 218 kWh, based on primary data from the reclaimer surveys.

The bales must be broken down and the material sorted to remove foreign material. The sorted materials may or may not go through a pre-washing stage before they are granulated to flake. Some amount of  reclaimed resin is received at the facility already in flake form. This flake may be clean or dirty, but all reclaimed flake is washed to market specifications as part of the reclaimer processing operations. This is most often achieved with a caustic wash, but different reclaimers reported using a variety of washing chemicals including surfactants, defoamers, and wetting agents. Clean postconsumer PET is commonly sold in flake form, or it can be pelletized. This unit process includes pelletizing ONLY. Steps for debaling, grinding, washing, drying, and granulating into flake are included in another linked unit process. Some reclaimers extrude the postconsumer PET directly into a staple fiber product. Depending on the level of processing, the postconsumer PET resin may be used for food-grade or non-food applications. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"For each facility, operating data normalized to basis of 1000 lb output, then individual reclaimer data sets were aggregated, weighting each data set according to the facility’s contribution to the total output of postconsumer recycled HDPE or PET ; Other assumtions and calculations described in Modeling Constants \u0026 Sampling Procedure.

Completed forms were received from 4 PET facilities and 6 HDPE facilities. The data sets were used to compile a weighted average for each resin based on each facility’s recycled resin output as a percentage of the total output of that recycled resin for all reporting facilities. As with the MRF data sets, only the weighted average data sets can be shown in order to protect the confidentiality of individual facility data sets. Assumptions and calculations are described in Modeling Constants and the supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nNo uncertainty estimations were included.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data compiled 2010 from most recent sources","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"7c9805e8-276e-3f66-bfa5-aa9d723cd357","name":"Franklin Associates (2011) LCI HDPE \u0026 PET Recycled Resin"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA).
