Data were developed for a full LCA that was critically reviewed.  Reviewers were: • Martha Stevenson, Chairperson – Private Consultant to the public interest with ten years of experience in sustainability, environmental management, packaging and materials recovery; led the development of the Design Guidelines for Sustainable Packaging and the COMPASS software used to compare the environmental impacts of package designs; • Pascal Lesage – Life cycle assessment consultant, Researcher at École Polytechnique de Montréal [at the Inter-University Research Centre for the Life Cycle of Products, Processes and Services (CIRAIG) in Montreal]; and • Dale Phenicie, Environmental Affairs Consulting – Consultant with 35 years of experience in environmental protection and process consulting for the forest products industry. Has served on several U.S. EPA Task Forces dealing with water quality issues and authored several AF\u0026PA Environmental, Health and Safety/Sustainability reports.","category":"31-33: Manufacturing/3221: Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills","version":"00.02.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-12-31","validUntil":"2005-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data collected from participating companies and associations for their operational activities are representative for 2006 and 2007.
