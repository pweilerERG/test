The process stages include: anthracite coal extraction and processing at mine. In surface/strip mining, the overburden (soil and rock covering the ore) is removed from shallow seams, the deposit is broken up, and the coal is loaded for transport. The overburden is generally returned to the mine (eventually) and is not considered as a solid waste in this data module. Underground mining is done primarily by one of two methods—room-and-pillar mining or longwall mining. Underground mining is a complex undertaking, and is much more labor and energy intensive than surface mining.\r\nAfter coal is mined, it goes through various preparation processes before it is used as fuel. These processes vary depending on the quality of the coal and the use for which it is intended. Coal preparation usually involves some type of size reduction, such as crushing and screening, and the removal of extraneous material introduced during mining. In addition, coal is often cleaned to upgrade the quality and heating value of the coal by removing or reducing the sulfur, clay, rock, and other ash-producing materials.\r\nSurface mining is used to extract 95 percent of anthracite coal, while underground mining is used to extract 5 percent. Approximately 64 percent of anthracite coal is cleaned. Small amounts of solid waste are produced from underground mining, while the remainder of solid waste comes from cleaning.","inventoryMethodDescription":"An attributional LCI method was used to develop the dataset.
