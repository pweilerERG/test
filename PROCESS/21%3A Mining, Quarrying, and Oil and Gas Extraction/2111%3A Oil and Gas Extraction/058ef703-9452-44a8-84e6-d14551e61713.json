Conventional natural gas is extracted using vertical well bores and using minimal stimulation. Unconventional natural gas extraction is used where permeability and porosity are so low that extraction requires a horizontal well bore followed by multistage hydraulic fracturing. Natural gas extraction is characterized by six types of extraction, namely onshore conventional, offshore conventional, associated natural gas, Barnett Shale, Marcellus Shale, and coalbed methane natural gas.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Data sets for the six natural gas extraction sources were linked to represent the U.S. natural gas mix.

The target audience of this model includes LCA practitioners, industry, and the general public. For use as an average dataset accepted by the North American plastics/chemical industry. An inventory of environmental emission flows are included to the extent that the producers provided; thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories.
