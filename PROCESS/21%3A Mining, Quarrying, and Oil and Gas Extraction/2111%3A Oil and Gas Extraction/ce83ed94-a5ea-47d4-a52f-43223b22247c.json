Crude oil extraction inputs include energy from natural gas, petroleum and other fossil fuels in addition to electricity use. The energy inputs are assumed to be the same for the domestic and imported on-shore and off-shore extraction processes.  The energy inputs of this process are taken from GREET model 2017. The emission data for the process is adapted from inventory data compiled by the National Energy Technology Lab.

Once an oil deposit is located, numerous holes are drilled and lined with steel casing. Some oil is brought to the surface by natural pressure in the rock structure, although most oil requires energy to drive pumps that lift oil to the surface. Once oil is on the surface, it is separated from water and stored in tanks before being transported to a refinery. In some cases, it is immediately transferred to a pipeline that transports the oil to a larger terminal.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; cradle to gate process.

The inventory for crude oil extraction accounts for emissions to air as reported in the NEI for U.S. extraction sites, greenhouse gas emissions from Cooney et. al. 2017, and emissions to water from EPA’s Discharge Monitoring Reports. Non-greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories for foreign oil extraction are unavailable so were assumed to scale linearly according to changes in carbon dioxide emission from domestic extraction. Emissions data from each U.S. county were allocated between oil extraction and natural gas based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and source classification codes included in the NEI. For cases in which not enough detail was provided from emissions records, emissions were allocated between oil and gas in that county based on the energy content of reported production. \r\n\r\nSolid wastes include drilling wastes and associated wastes as calculated from statistics in EPA 2000 and API 2000. Drilling wastes include solids from brine water and drilling mud, while associated wastes are tank bottoms, contaminated soil and scale or sludges from radioactive materials. \r\n","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nThe system boundary includes incoming fuel use, crude oil extraction, and process waste management.

LCA studies with this intended application offer \"purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g., a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy.” The studies categorized under Goal Situation C1 do consider existing benefits outside the analyzed system such as recycling. A full inventory of environmental flows are included; thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories. The target audience of this model includes LCA practitioners, industry, and the general public. For use as an average dataset accepted by the North American plastics/chemical industry. An inventory of environmental emission flows are included to the extent that the producers provided; thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories.
