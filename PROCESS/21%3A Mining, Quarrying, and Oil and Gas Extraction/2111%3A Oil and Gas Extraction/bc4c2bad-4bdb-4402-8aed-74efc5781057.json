Conventional offshore natural gas is recovered by vertical drilling techniques. Once a conventional offshore gas well has been discovered, the natural gas reservoir does not require significant preparation or stimulation for natural gas recovery. A natural gas reservoir must be large in order to justify the capital outlay for the completion of the well and construction of an offshore drilling platform. The majority of U.S. offshore wells are in the Gulf of Mexico.

Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"The input and output data for each of the subprocesses is taken from NETL unit process library and the most recent data is from 2010. The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater.
