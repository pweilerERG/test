Once raw natural gas is extracted, it is processed to yield a marketable product. First, the heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane, butane and propane are removed and marketed as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Then the water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are removed to increase the quality and heating value of the natural gas. If the natural gas has a high hydrogen sulfide content, it is considered “sour.” Before it is used, hydrogen sulfide is removed by adsorption in an amine solution—a process known as “sweetening.”  Atmospheric emissions result from the flaring of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the regeneration of glycol solutions, and fugitive emissions of methane. Glycol solutions are used to dehydrate natural gas, and the regeneration of these solutions result in the release of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) as well as a variety of less toxic organics. Methane emissions result from fugitive releases as well as venting. Negligible particulate emissions are produced from natural gas plants, and the relatively low processing temperatures (\u003c1,200 degrees Fahrenheit) prevent the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Energy data for natural gas processing were calculated from fuel consumption data for the natural gas liquids extraction industry. Processed natural gas is transported primarily by pipeline, but a small percentage is compressed and transported by insulated railcars and tankers. Transportation data were calculated from the net annual quantities of natural gas imported and exported by each state. The data for this process are based on publicly available sources and represent production technologies used in the United States. \r\n","category":"21: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction/2111: Oil and Gas Extraction","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.117Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-12-31","validUntil":"2017-11-30","timeDescription":"GREET 2017","geographyDescription":"United States","technologyDescription":"Conventional natural gas processing.
