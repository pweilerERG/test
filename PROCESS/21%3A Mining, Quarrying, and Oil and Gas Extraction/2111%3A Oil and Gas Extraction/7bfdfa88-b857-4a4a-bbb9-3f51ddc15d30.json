Natural gas is extracted from deep underground wells and is frequently co-produced with crude oil. Because of its gaseous nature, natural gas flows quite freely from wells which produce primarily natural gas, but some energy is required to pump natural gas and crude oil mixtures to the surface. An estimated 80 percent of natural gas is extracted onshore and 20 percent is extracted offshore. Atmospheric emissions from natural gas production result primarily from unflared venting, as well as fugitive CO2 emissions. Sulfur was given no coproduct allocation in this process.\r\n","category":"21: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction/2111: Oil and Gas Extraction","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.117Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-12-31","validUntil":"2017-11-30","timeDescription":"","geographyDescription":"","technologyDescription":"Unconventinal natural gas processing for fuel use","inventoryMethodDescription":"Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"For the shale gas processing unit process, inputs include energy sources, electricity and water and outputs include emissions to air.
