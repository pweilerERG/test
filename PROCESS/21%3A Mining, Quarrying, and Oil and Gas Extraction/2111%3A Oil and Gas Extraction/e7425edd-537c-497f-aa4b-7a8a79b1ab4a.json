Natural gas is dispersed throughout the Barnett Shale formation in northern Texas and the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin. Shale gas cannot be recovered using conventional extraction technologies but is recovered through the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking). Horizontal drilling creates a wellbore that runs the length of a shale formation, and hydrofracking uses high pressure fluid (a mixture of water, surfactants, and proppants) for breaking apart the shale reservoir and facilitating the flow of natural gas. Approximately 11 percent of new pipeline capacity in 2008 (4.8 billion cubic feet per day) was installed for natural gas from Barnett Shale (US EIA, 2009g).","category":"21: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction/2111: Oil and Gas Extraction","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.117Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-12-31","validUntil":"2014-11-30","timeDescription":"NETL LCA Unit Process Library, Natural gas extraction processes 2010.

The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater.
