LCA studies with this intended application offer \"purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g., a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy.‚Äù The studies categorized under Goal Situation C1 do consider existing benefits outside the analyzed system such as recycling. A full inventory of environmental flows are included; thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories. The target audience of this model includes LCA practitioners, industry, and the general public. For use as an average dataset accepted by the North American plastics/chemical industry. An inventory of environmental emission flows are included to the extent that the producers provided; thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories. The original study results were analyzed using the TRACI LCIA factors. ","projectDescription":"This project was funded by and submitted to the American Chemistry Council.
