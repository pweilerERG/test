Associated natural gas is co-extracted with crude oil. The extraction of onshore associated gas is similar to the extraction methods for conventional onshore gas. The use of oil/gas separators is necessary to recover natural gas from the mixed product stream. The majority of these wells are assumed to be in Texas and Louisiana (US EIA, 2009a). The production rates of onshore associated gas wells are highly variable, but an average associated gas well in the U.S. produces 59 barrels of oil and 61 thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day (US EIA, 2009b).

The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater.
