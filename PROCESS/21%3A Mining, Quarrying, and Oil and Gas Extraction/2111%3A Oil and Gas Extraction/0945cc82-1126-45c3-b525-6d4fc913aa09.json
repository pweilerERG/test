Natural gas can be recovered from coal seams using horizontal drilling. Coalbed methane (CBM) was first extracted from coal mines as a safety measure to reduce the explosion hazard posed by methane gas in the mines. Deeper coal formations might require hydraulic fracturing to release the natural gas. The development of a well for coal bed methane requires horizontal drilling followed by a depressurization period during which naturally-occurring water is discharged from the coal seam. There are viable coal bed methane deposits nationwide, but the majority of CBM production occurs in the Rocky Mountain region (ALL Consulting, 2004).

The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater.
