This model is based on European data but has been adapted to represent US conditions. Data were originally collected by Schreiber et al., 2020 and have been adapted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Details for this dataset are restricted due to confidentiality. The system boundary of this dataset includes the main incoming materials with transportation and air emissions but excludes periphery materials such as cables and motors. It is important to note that this model is a rough estimation of the materials and emissions associated with constructing a small-scale steam methane reforming plant. This data should not be used for the construction of a large-scale plant due to different designs.","category":"23: Construction/2362: Nonresidential Building Construction","version":"00.01.000","lastChange":"2024-06-27T18:04:33.101Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2022-12-31","timeDescription":"This unit process is representative of data collected from a study that was published in 2020.
