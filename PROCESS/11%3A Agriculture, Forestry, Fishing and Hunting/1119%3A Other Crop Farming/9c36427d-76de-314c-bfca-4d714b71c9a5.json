Based on projections from Sokhansanj et al. 2009 and MacLaughlin and Kszos 2005. The mean swithgrass yield in the US in 2008 was estimated to be 11.3 Mg per ha, this includes both upland and lowland varieties. The projected 2022 yield was determined by the following (2022 yield \u003d (2008 yield)*(1+.02)^14, where the 2008 yield \u003d 11.2 Mg per hectare, 0.02 is the 2% annual yield improvement, and 14 is the number of years. The annual rate of yield increase is estimated to be 2%. This process Includes all crop productin processes from field preperation to harvest and baling. Assuming a 10-year stand.  Transport and storage of bales is not included.","category":"11: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting/1119: Other Crop Farming","version":"00.00.008","lastChange":"2023-03-31T19:04:06.996Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-12-31","validUntil":"2100-12-30","timeDescription":"2010 and after","geographyDescription":"North America","technologyDescription":"Future technology","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
