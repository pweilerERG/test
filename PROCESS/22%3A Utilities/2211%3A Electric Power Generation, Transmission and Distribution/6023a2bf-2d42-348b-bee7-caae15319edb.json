This quantity is calculated from the amount exported to the U.S. as bauxite ore and the amount used within each country to produce alumina, which is then exported to the U.S.\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to
