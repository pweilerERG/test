{"@type":"Process","@id":"4d21df14-9a73-31ce-9a5f-dee0cd2a2aed","name":"Electricity, aluminum smelting and ingot casting regions","description":"Aluminum smelting is based upon an electrolytic process; therefore, a relatively large quantity of electricity is used to produce primary aluminum. According to IPAI 2002 statistics, the electricity profile for North American (Canada and the U.S.) smelters consists of the following fuels: hydro, 63.9%; coal, 34.6%; oil, 0.1%; natural gas, 0.4%; and nuclear, 0.9%. Of this electricity, 35.2% is self-generated and 64.8% is purchased.\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to lci@nrel.gov.","category":"22: Utilities/2211: Electric Power Generation, Transmission and
