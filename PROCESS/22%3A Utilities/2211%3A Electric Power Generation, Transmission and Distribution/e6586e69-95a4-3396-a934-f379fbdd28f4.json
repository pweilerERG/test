{"@type":"Process","@id":"e6586e69-95a4-3396-a934-f379fbdd28f4","name":"Electricity, at cogen, for natural gas turbine","description":"This unit process shows the amount of natural gas required to generate 1 kWh of electricity from the natural gas-fired cogeneration of electricity and steam. The input energy requirements for cogenerated electricity are estimated to be 6,826 Btu/kWh, which is based a thermal to electrical conversion efficiency of 50 percent. This unit process does not include the fuel requirements for the coproduced steam because the steam produced from cogeneration is exported outside system boundaries; if any coproduct steam from cogeneration is used within system boundaries (i.e., coproduct steam is used for the same process as the coproduct electricity) a more complicated allocation method is necessary in which the fraction of steam used within system boundaries must be known. Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices (A-34), Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
