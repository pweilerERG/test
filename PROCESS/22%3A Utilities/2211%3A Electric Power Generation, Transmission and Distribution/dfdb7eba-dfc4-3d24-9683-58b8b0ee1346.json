Electricity generation is accomplished by gasification of biomass followed by a gas turbine. Biomass is produced within the boundaries of this system and is thus not shown as a fuel input. This is cradle-to-gate data, spanning the extraction of fuels and raw materials through the production of electricity. Infrastructure requirments for biomass production, biomass gasification, and biomass electricity generation are also included. Process and fuel emissions are reported together in the original data source and cannot be separated., \nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to lci@nrel.gov.","category":"22: Utilities/2211: Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution","version":"00.02.007","lastChange":"2024-06-24T19:30:59.881Z","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-12-31","validUntil":"1996-12-31","geographyDescription":"United States","technologyDescription":"Biomass production is represented by a poplar tree plantation with a seven-year growing cycle.
