Data were collected from 1997-2003 from industry and EPA sources. Data for ash and sulfur content for anthracite coal used by industry boilers were assumed to be the same as and collected from utility boiler data. Air and water emissions were calculated from EPA sources. An unknown allocation type was used for this dataset. The system boundary of this dataset includes incoming coal and transport, solid waste disposal, and air and water emissions and system boundary exclusions are unknown. The following technology was used: a mix of stoker boilers (70%), fluidized bed combustion boilers (20%), and pulverized coal boilers (10%). This metadata was populated based on a 2004 module report.

The process stages include: anthracite coal combustion in industrial boilers. Industrial combustion of coal is treated separately from combustion of coal for utility boilers because pollutants are often different. Industries often do not burn coal in boilers as large as or of the same type as the utility boilers. They also do not always burn the same kinds of coal. Statistics on coal quality show little difference in the ash and sulfur content between utility and industrial coal. However, particulate control is generally less efficient for industrial coal boilers, and sulfur oxide controls are rarely employed. A mix of boiler types were used in this dataset based on an industry split: stoker boilers (70%), fluidized bed combustion boilers (20%), and pulverized coal boilers (10%). It was assumed that cleaning wastes are less for industrial boilers than for utility boilers. Since few industrial boilers employ environmental control equipment, it was assumed that industrial boilers produce 10 percent of the fly ash and FGD wastes of utility boilers.","inventoryMethodDescription":"An attributional LCI method was used to develop the dataset.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n","modelingConstantsDescription":"It is unknown if this process was adapted from another process  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: \nElementary flows are cut-off at less than unknown based on unknown.\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE FLOWS\n: Technosphere flows are cut-off at less than unknown based on unknown.
