The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA). Using life cycle inventory (LCI) methodology, the study determines and quantifies the energy requirements, solid wastes, and atmospheric and waterborne emissions for the processes required to collect postconsumer PET and HDPE packaging, sort and separate the material, and reprocess it into clean recycled resin.\r\n\r\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used","modelingConstantsDescription":"Postconsumer plastics that are collected mixed with other materials must be separated; data are from Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) – 4 data sets and Plastic Recycling Facility (PRF) – 1 confidential data set\r\nMRF data validated by checking against equipment data in EPA’s MSW Decision Support Tool; Each facility’s data on material transport, energy use, and solid wastes were normalized to basis of 1000 lb of output from the facility; Weighted average sorting/separation data set was compiled for each resin based on percent of total postconsumer supply sorted at MRF and PRF facilities \r\n\r\n\r\nTransport requirements include transporting weight of incoming contaminant materials.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA\r\nElementary flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA\r\nIntermediate flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.

Inputs of waste amounts to disposal are for disposal of contaminants removed from material at sorting facility.","dataSelectionDescription":"Once the postconsumer PET, HDPE, and PP have been collected, they must be separated from other co-collected materials and plastics. Although some recovered plastic is separated by curbside sorting and the use of separate bins at drop-off recycling centers, sorting and separation of plastics most commonly takes place at material recovery facilities (MRFs). Sorting operations at MRFs range from manual sorting of items on a conveyor to highly automated systems using magnets, air classifiers, optical sorters, and other technologies to sort and separate mixed incoming materials. Postconsumer plastics may be separated and baled as mixed plastics, or the facility may have the capability to further sort down to individual resin bales.","dataTreatmentDescription":"For sorting at MRFs, total solid wastes were allocated over the total pounds of useful output, so that the pounds of MRF sorting waste is the same for 1,000 pounds of output, whether it is PET, HDPE, PP. The same approach was used to calculate the sorting waste per 1,000 pounds of output material for the PRF. Other assumtions and calculations described in Data Treatment \u0026 Modeling Constants.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nProcessing steps include the incoming transport of collected mixed recyclables to the material recycling facility (MRF) and energy requirements for the subsequent sorting of plastics from other co-collected recovered materials (such as paper, steel, and aluminum), and separating mixed plastics into individual resins.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION\r\nFor the original (2011) recycled resin analysis, data were collected from MRFs and a PRF using data collection forms developed specifically for the project by ERG. Four completed MRF surveys and one completed PRF survey were received. For the MRFs, one data set was for a large facility that processed both single-stream and dual-stream collected material, two were for medium dual-stream facilities, and one was for a small dual-stream facility. The data provided on the forms included information on the sources of material received at theMRF, the transportation mode and distance for incomingmaterial from each source, the types and quantities of useful materials recovered from the incoming material, the types of equipment used at the facility, energy and water use at the facility, and the solid wastes, atmospheric and waterborne emissions from the facility. For each facility, the operating data were allocated over the total weight of recovered materials. Individual MRF facility data cannot be shown because of data confidentiality; however, a\r\nweighted average data set was developed based on the amount of collected plastic material processed at each type of facility, using the single- and dual-stream collection data compiled for collection percent by type.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nNo uncertainty estimations were included.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data compiled 2010 from most recent sources","sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"7c9805e8-276e-3f66-bfa5-aa9d723cd357","name":"Franklin Associates (2011) LCI HDPE \u0026 PET Recycled Resin"}],"reviews":[{"reviewType":"","scopes":[],"details":"The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA).
